"""
Formalized end-to-end pipeline: stream -> monitor -> classify -> SPARTA
context -> mitigate -> report.

Process choice: SEQUENTIAL, not hierarchical. Week 3 testing showed every
agent's tool is deterministic and the pipeline order is fixed by design
(Monitor always gates before Classifier; Classifier always runs before
SPARTA/Mitigation/Reporter) -- there's no decision about *which* agent to
call next that needs a manager LLM to make. A hierarchical process would
add cost, latency, and unpredictability for zero benefit here.

Guardrails:
  1. Confidence threshold before autonomous mitigation fires: already
     enforced inside decide_mitigation()'s policy bands (below 0.70,
     every class falls to a non-autonomous action).
  2. Fallback to "flag for review" on agent disagreement / malformed tool
     output: if the SPARTA or Mitigation tool returns an "error" key
     (e.g. an unrecognized class name), the pipeline stops autonomous
     handling and marks the incident FLAGGED_FOR_REVIEW instead of
     guessing.
